-= Compiling with make =-

To compile you need a the gcc-avr toolchain and standard make utilities.
On Ubuntu/Debian this can be installed with:

apt-get install build-essential gcc-avr avr-libc binutils-avr avrdude

After that execute "make" in the main directory, and the modem firmware should compile.

You can use avrdude to flash to an Arduino compatible board. Have a look at the "flash" script, it makes this easy. If your board is connected to /dev/ttyUSB0, simply run:

./flash USB0

And avrdude should upload the firmware to the board.


-= Eclipse =-

If you want to use the Eclipse IDE, follow these steps:

- Install the AVR-eclipse plugin from http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Plugin_Download
- In eclipse, create a new project (File -> New -> Project…)
- In the new project box, select C/C++ -> “Makefile Project with Existing Code”
- Select a name, and locate the MicroModem folder for “Existing Code Location”
- Select “AVR-GCC Toolchain” in “Toolchain for indexer settings”
- Click “Finish”
